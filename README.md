# EDA-Project-House-Prices
My first EDA-Project 

House-Price-Prediction-of-King-County-USA Prediction of the price variable

My project included analysis/EDA with the dataset of the King County house sales. It includes over 20.000 data entries about houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. 

In my jupyter notebook file you can see my procedure of data mining, data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, predicitve modeling and data visualization.
The Features 'Sqft_living', 'Grade' and 'Sqft_above' have the greatest explanatory content for the 'Price' lable.
There is also a big relationship between the features 'Lat' and ' 'Long' to the 'Price' lable. This is because the location has a big influence to the house price. On average, the price of a house with a basement is $ 100,000 greater than that of a house without a basement.

The PDF-File includes the presentation slides about the project above.
In the jupyter notebook you can find a data science lifecycle about the King County House Price Prediction.
