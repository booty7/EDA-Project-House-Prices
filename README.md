# EDA-Project-House-Prices
My first EDA-Project 
House-price-Prediction-of-King-County-USA Prediction of the variable price

My project included analysis/EDA with the dataset of the King County house sales. It includes houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Befor the EDA i cleaned the data. Then i visualized with histogram and scatter plots dependencys. After this i used multivariate linear regression to building a model.
